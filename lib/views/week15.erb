<h3>Weekend wrap-up:</h3><br />
<p>
In an effort to find a book that would help me interact with people that don't put such a high value on life-long learning, I stumbled across another book, which was pretty much the opposite of what I was looking for but now, it seems, I don't care about my first hunt any longer.<br />
Started and finished reading <a href="http://www.geoffcolvin.com/books/talent-is-overrated-by-geoff-colvin/"><i>"Talent is Overrated" by Geoff Colvin</i></a>.  It's so funny that <i>"The Secret"</i> should be so popular when the book by Colvin has, without exageration, the <b>REAL</b> "secret" to success.  But, unlike "magic", there is work involved and that scares away the majority of people.  Colvin's book is still a best seller so there's hope for humanity yet!  I was excstatic to find such a thorough book on the subject.  I will be employing these techniques of deliberate practice from now on.  So I decided to come up with a multi-pronged attack plan for increasing my skills.

<br />
<h3>Deliberate Practice Plan</h3><br />
<ol>
  <li>Feedback loop</li>
    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
      <li>Each subject area has it's own feedback loop (including feedback loops in general)</li>
      <li>Like the unit test, each loop will have expectations for quantifiable results within scope of the domain of study</li>
      <li>Feedback loops will favour "learning zone" area of difficulty</li>
      <li>Feedback loops will also favour quick results on repeatable functions with documentable modifications to process</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
      <li>Study <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming"><i>"The Art of Computing"</i> by Donald Knuth</a>.  Never read it, always wanted to.  OR...</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE621E25B3BF8B9D1&feature=plcp">Youtube lectures</a> by <a href="https://wiki.cse.unsw.edu.au/gandt/RichardBuckland/CV">Richard Buckland</a></li>
