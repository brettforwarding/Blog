<h3>Weekend wrap-up:</h3><br />
<p>
Well, have several loose ends at the moment:
<ol>
  <li>Blog: Implementing a database.  A bit of a learning curve to tackle how it works with Heroku.  Seems like they use Postgre, but I haven't installed that yet.</li>
  <li>TAOCP: Only made it to Vol I, page 5 of Knuth's epic work but there's no reason to rush it.  Still...only page 5 ?!?</li>
  <li>Buckland's lecture 7:  I don't think I'll be able to do this at the same time as it's covered in TOACP, so I'll pick this back up again.</li>
  <li>Writing skills:  Read a greating writing magazine cover-to-cover and I need to make some notes</li>
  <li>Disseminate what I learned from the "Atlas".  This is where I spent last week and the weekend.  Wow!  What an amazing book, can't wait to review!</li>
</ol>
Ayn Rand's 1000+ page amazing philisophical work, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a>, set in an engaging fictional story was long but I just couldn't put it down.  She nailed it!  As close to the meaning of life as I have ever seen.  If a happy, successful life could be compared to a newly built skyscraper then I could say, without reservation, that this would make an excellent blueprint to the foundation.  This should be required reading for anyone proclaiming free-thought.  I have been very lucky to have hit on 3 excellent works lately to provide me with drive and direction to aid in my personal advancement.  Now, to the application of this new material...
