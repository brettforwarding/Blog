<h3>Weekend wrap-up:</h3><br />
<p>
Well, week 20 was unproductive.  In addition, week 21 dissappeared because my weekends don't always line up with calendar weekends.  So it seems like I've done nothing for almost 2 weeks!<br />
<br />
The truth is, I have been productive.  At least, I was productive after my 3 days of Diablo III.<br />
<br />
The weekend (my "weekend") was a working weekend, thanks to my very understanding and very appreciated wife.  This weekend I tackled a new virtual machine for development:  <a href="/environment/crunchbang">crunchbang</a>.
