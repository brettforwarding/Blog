<h3>Weekend wrap-up:</h3><br />
<p>
Spent a long time on my average-sort method.  Resolved my issues through brute force, and as usual, I was off only by a special case I’d overlooked but had a feeling was there, and an end case error.  I successfully ported the sort.rb and test_sort.rb to my web directories.  Testing was a semi-success.  I can’t run rack::test on my 1.9.3 so I used 1.9.2.  Down side here is that I only went to 1.9.3 because 1.9.2 I couldn’t get running with Heroku.  So I haven’t been using my http tests.
