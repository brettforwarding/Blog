<h3>Weekend wrap-up:</h3><br />
<p>
Settled in...for now.  Already met someone who may be interested in working with 
me on a contract basis - good to be back in a city!  Since Facebook integration 
is a big interest, I decided that creating a new, more public-friendly blog would be 
a great way to test this since I had the intention of creating a more appealing blog in 
the first place.  <br /><br />
